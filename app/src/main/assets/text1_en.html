<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;"><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public goods are the group of assets and rights belonging to the population, which are maintained by the taxes paid by these citizens that possess the right to enjoy the assets, being protected by laws that punish the offenders that deteriorate the collective goods.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of public good, there’s the scholastic ambient, being an area that includes the immaterial goods that surround the institution, as culture, values and pedagogic projects, as well as material goods, which is everything that may be seen and touched in the scholastic ambient.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school represents a space of social coexistence, of integration of ideas and persons, but also of confrontation and conflict, therefore a space susceptible to the goods’ depredation.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though schools have an important purpose, most of the brazilian ones are found degraded, from an act caused by the feeling of unbelonging to these institutions, coming from the students.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To insert the public goods, specially the scholastic ones, in a debate about preservation, establishing dialogs, is a challenge to be faced and an urgent need, given that it’s hard for a school to achieve good learning indexes with students and professors coexisting in a danified local, without the minimum needed resources.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preservation of the goods used by the community, where the students feel like a part of the space, results in institutions with resources and good learning indexes, beyond the well-being of all the education community.<p>
