<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-size: larger;">What’s the point in Apptrimônio?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">The role of Apptrimônio is to inform IFSC’s community, specially the students, about the public goods contained in the campus.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-size: larger;">Who may use app?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">Everyone! We try hard to make Apptrimônio accessible and active among all of the sets that compose IFSC’s community :)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-size: larger;">How does it work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large;">Access your phone’s camera using the app and scan the QR code contained on the chosen object, pointing the camera directly to it. You will be redirected to a page dedicated to the object at hand, showing infos as value and purchase date!
    If you have a manager’s account (only for IFSC’s employees), you’ll also have the option to create QR codes. You have to print the QR created and paste it on the object you want to register, adding the available infos about it in the app.
    Beyond these functions, it’s also possible to access the informative texts made available by us, here in the platform, which talk about important issues in our app’s scope: public good!</p>
